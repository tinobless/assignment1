//////interest in it {85%}


What is your interest in it? when did your interest start was there a specific event or person that sparked your passion?

my interest in information technology began at a very early age, my mother is a person who enjoys putting things together and this enjoyment has been passed on to me, i love putting electronics together and have strong thirst to understand how they work; in my latter years of high school i gained a strong interest in national security issues, from foreign relations to Cyber-warfare in 2018 mike burgess director general asd gave a speech to aspi whereby he said
 ''Everything is being digitised, everything is being connected and everything is being controlled by software. And there is no doubt, the full potential of connectivity, technology and software are yet to be fully realised. However, these same benefits represent a significant risk.''

the quote at the time was the catalyst in my passion for for Cyber-security, i one day hope i can be there to mitigate the risks inherent in our modern world of interconnectivity; despite my passion for ict, i have very little experience working in the industry, what little experience i have comprises of working as a contractor to fix & refurbish old office computers as well as building/repairing personal computers and laptops. i hope to rectify this lack of experience in the coming years.

why rmit?

ict is a very complex and technical industry, when looking at job positions i quickly found that if i wanted to become a cybersecurity expert, i would require qualifications and experience, and with my lack of revenue i needed an educational institute that was relatively close to my home this critera made rmit an obvious choice, rmit is reputable for providing good quality education in stem and thus i chose to come to rmit and study the bachelor of information technology.

what do i expect to learn during my studies?

upon finishing my studies i expect to have learnt the knowledge and expertise necessary to pursue my interests in cybersecurity and ict in general;
my skill set should be broad and adaptable to various environments since all workplaces are the same this includes skills in programming, networking and information security,
i also expect to have a broad knowledge base which forms an important foundation for further professional development, the ict industry is fast moving and workplaces will expect me to be able to
continuously learn new skills and techniques to more efficiently complete my job this includes a strong  working knowledge about cryptography, cloud systems, and programming; 
i don't expect to finish my course and be able to revolutionize the industry, instead i should have the skills and knowledge to pursue further education and work autonomously to complete organisational goals and objectives.


{{{section objective}}}
this section when completed should create a narrative of a child who loves ict discovering rmit which provides a way to gain the ability
to enter the profession

what do these results mean for you? 

the results of personality tests dont mean much to me, they provide false inside about my personality which can be used to justify my actions, but otherwise i belive that insights into my personality is better found from  talking to a qualified health professional who can qualify the accuracy of my results and provide clearer insights self reporting issues and day to day changes in self image.

how do these results influence your behaviour in a team?

the results of personality tests can reinforce specific behaviours as you use the results to explain them away, otherwise i do not think personality tests provide a deep insight into my personality

how should you take this into account when forming a team?

when forming i team you should seek the most skilled individuals of which you get along with, not set personality types
